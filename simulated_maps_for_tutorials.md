To validate the ABS method we have simulated a few foregrounds maps including dust and synchrotron at 30, 95, 150 and 353 GHz, using [PySM](https://github.com/bthorne93/PySM_public) package. [CAMB](https://camb.info/) is utilized to predict the CMB power spectra with respect to the Planck best fit 2018 results, from which random realizations of CMB anisotropies are obtained. For the tensor-to-scalar ratio, we set it as 0.05 for the generation of CMB maps. White noise maps are generated according to the Planck level.
